We ducked into his car. I kissed him first. Of course I did. I wanted to taste that moment and own it. He leaned back, a little stunned, and I went low. Between the seats I let my mouth manifest how I felt for him, I never felt him so hard and big! I claimed space like a queen with a mission but stopped before he erupted. His breath hitched but then her turn me around and I felt his power and the depth of his love. Felt like a stroke of power, aching pain but so pleasurable. My hands were clumsy, lips confident. I let the rhythm guide me — Bad Bunny pounding through the speakers, and my man pounding me through the back. I saw headlights flashed behind us, but he didn’t stop. I almost smiled, but couldn’t… my mouth was wide open as he continued to thrust harder and harder until he finally lay against my back."
